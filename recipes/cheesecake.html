        <h4>For the topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>500g small British strawberries, some halved, some left whole</li>
            <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>Good splash Cointreau or other orange liqueur</li>
            <li>Juice ½ lemon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 160°C/fan140°C/ gas 3. Crush the digestives to fine crumbs, then mix in the melted butter and freeze-dried strawberries. Press into the base of a 20cm springform cake tin to cover completely. Chill in the fridge while you make the filling.</li>
        <li>Using an electric hand whisk, whip the cream cheese with the rest of the cheesecake ingredients in a bowl until light and fluffy. Spoon evenly over the chilled base, then bake for 60-70 minutes until set but slightly wobbly in the centre. Turn off the oven with the cheesecake inside and allow to cool completely (see tips).</li>
        <li>About 30 minutes before serving, put the strawberries with all the other topping ingredients into a bowl, stir to coat, then leave to macerate. Remove the cheesecake from the tin, decorate with the macerated strawberries and serve.</li>
        </ol>
